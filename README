== HOW TO COMPILE SCSOLVER UNO PACKAGE ==

=== Instructions ===

To compile the separate UNO package named scsolver.uno.zip that can be 
installed on a version of OOo that doesn't have the Solver pre-installed, 
follow these steps.  

1. First, you need to have OOo itself installed somewhere on your system, and
   the version of OOo SDK compatible with your OOo installation.

2. Download, unpack and build the lp_solve library in a separate directory.  
   You can download the lp_solve 5.5.0.10 package from our mirror.  To do it, 
   run these commands in this order:

   wget http://download.go-oo.org/SRC680/lp_solve_5.5.0.12_source.tar.gz
   tar xvf lp_solve_5.5.0.12_source.tar.gz
   cd lp_solve_5.5/lpsolve55
   sh ccc

3. Now, change directory into ext, and create and run autogen.sh.

   cd ext
   ./autogen.sh \
       --with-ooo=/path/to/ooo/install \
       --with-ooo-sdk=/path/to/ooo/sdk \
       --with-lpsolve=/path/to/lpsolve

   NOTE 1) Use an absolute path to specify the location of the OOo installation,
   OOo SDK, and the base lpsolve path.

4. If all goes well, simply run make to build scsolver.uno.oxt.

   make

5. At this point, you can launch OOo Calc and manually install this package
   from GUI, or you can do this from the command line:

   make install

   this will execute the 'unopkg add' command to register scsolver.uno.oxt.

=== FAQ ===

Q. I'm getting the following error:

   ./autogen.sh: line 4: aclocal: command not found

   What am I missing?

A. You need to install 'autoconf' (and 'automake' too?) in order to successfully
   run the autogen.sh script.

Q. I'm getting boost/shared_ptr.hpp: no such file or directory error.  What 
   should I do?

A. You need to install boost-devel package to get the boost header files 
   installed, because scsolver makes use of boost shared_ptr and ublas matrix 
   libraries.
